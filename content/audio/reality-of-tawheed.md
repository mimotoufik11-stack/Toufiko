In this comprehensive audio lecture, Shaykh Salih al-Fawzan explains the reality of Tawheed (Islamic monotheism) and its central importance in Islam. The scholar begins by defining Tawheed linguistically and technically, then explores its three categories: Tawheed of Lordship (Rububiyyah), Tawheed of Worship (Uluhiyyah), and Tawheed of Names and Attributes (Asma wa Sifat).

The lecture emphasizes that Tawheed is not merely a theoretical concept but a practical reality that must be implemented in every aspect of a Muslim's life. Shaykh al-Fawzan provides numerous examples from the Qur'an and Sunnah to illustrate how Tawheed affects one's worship, daily affairs, and relationship with Allah.

The scholar also addresses common misconceptions about Tawheed and warns against practices that contradict pure monotheism. This lecture serves as an excellent introduction for new Muslims and a beneficial reminder for those already familiar with the topic, delivered with the clarity and scholarly precision characteristic of the major scholars of our time.
