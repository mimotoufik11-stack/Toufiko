## Introduction

Family ties hold a sacred position in Islam, with maintaining them (silat ar-rahim) being one of the most emphasized religious duties. The Qur'an and Sunnah contain numerous promises of reward for those who preserve family connections and warnings for those who sever them.

## Divine Commands and Promises

Allah commands maintaining family ties alongside the command to worship Him: "And fear Allah through whom you demand one another, and sever not the ties of kinship" (Qur'an 4:1). The Prophet (ﷺ) informed us that maintaining family ties prolongs lifespan, increases sustenance, and serves as a means of entering Paradise.

## Scope of Family Ties

Islamic scholars explain that family ties include all blood relatives, with priority given to closer relatives such as parents, siblings, children, and grandparents. The obligation extends even to relatives who may be difficult to deal with or have previously severed ties.

## Practical Methods of Maintaining Ties

The article details various ways to maintain family ties: regular visits, financial support when needed, giving gifts, offering advice, making dua for relatives, and participating in their joyous and difficult occasions. The methodology emphasizes wisdom, patience, and prioritizing reconciliation over being right.

## Contemporary Challenges

In modern times, maintaining family ties faces new challenges including geographical separation, busy schedules, and differing levels of religious practice. The article provides practical solutions for these challenges while emphasizing that Islamic principles remain timeless and applicable regardless of changing circumstances.
