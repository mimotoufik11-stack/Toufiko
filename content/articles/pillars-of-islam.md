## Introduction

The five pillars of Islam form the foundation of a Muslim's worship and obedience. Each pillar is established upon clear
texts from the Qur'an and authentic Sunnah, guiding the believer towards certainty and steadfastness.

## The testimony of faith

The statement *La ilaha illa Allah, Muhammadur Rasul Allah* is the key to Islam. It affirms the oneness of Allah in His
worship and the obligation to follow the Messenger (ﷺ) in all affairs.

## Establishing the prayer

The Prophet (ﷺ) emphasised prayer as the pillar of the religion. The scholars have unanimously agreed on its obligation
five times daily, performed with humility, presence of heart, and adherence to the prophetic method.

## Giving zakah

Zakah purifies wealth and hearts alike. The categories of wealth liable for zakah and their threshold (nisab) are derived
from evidences clarified by classical jurists, and remain applicable today with contemporary analogies.

## Fasting Ramadan

Fasting instils taqwa and disciplines the soul. The rulings of intention, pre-dawn meals, and matters breaking the fast
are detailed in the statements of the scholars.

## Pilgrimage to the House

Hajj is obligatory once in a lifetime for those able. The rites, from assuming ihram to the farewell tawaf, were taught
in detail by the Messenger (ﷺ) and preserved through the practice of the companions.
