## Question

Is it permissible to work in conventional banks that deal with interest (riba)? What are the alternatives for Muslims seeking careers in finance?

## Answer

The Permanent Committee has issued clear rulings that working in conventional banks is not permissible due to the direct involvement with riba (interest), which is explicitly prohibited in the Qur'an. Allah declared war on those who deal with riba, and the Prophet (ﷺ) cursed the one who accepts it, the one who pays it, the one who records it, and the two witnesses to it.

## Prohibited Roles

Roles that directly involve riba transactions include:
- Bank tellers and cashiers handling interest-based transactions
- Loan officers arranging interest-bearing loans
- Accountants recording interest income and expenses
- Managers supervising riba-based operations

## Permissible Alternatives

Muslims should seek employment in Islamic financial institutions that comply with Shariah principles. These include:
- Islamic banks offering profit-and-loss sharing arrangements
- Takaful (Islamic insurance) companies
- Shariah-compliant investment firms
- Accounting and auditing firms specializing in Islamic finance

If no alternatives are available and one faces extreme hardship, some scholars permit working in peripheral roles not directly involved in riba transactions, but this should be temporary while actively seeking halal employment.
