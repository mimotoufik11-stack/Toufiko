Imam Muhammad ibn Ismail al-Bukhari (رحمه الله), born in 810 CE in Bukhara (modern-day Uzbekistan), stands as one of the greatest scholars of Hadith in Islamic history. His compilation, "Sahih al-Bukhari," is universally recognized as the most authentic book after the Qur'an.

Early in life, al-Bukhari lost his father but was raised by his mother, who recognized his extraordinary memory and intellectual capabilities. He began memorizing Hadith at age ten and performed Hajj with his mother and brother at age sixteen, after which he remained in the Hijaz to seek knowledge from its scholars.

Imam al-Bukhari traveled extensively throughout the Islamic world, studying under more than 1,000 scholars and collecting over 600,000 narrations. His methodology for verifying Hadith authenticity was unprecedented, requiring that each narrator be of proven reliability, have met the narrator before them, and maintain perfect accuracy in transmission.

After sixteen years of meticulous work, he completed his monumental collection, selecting approximately 7,275 Hadith (with repetitions) that met his strict criteria. Sahih al-Bukhari became the gold standard for Hadith authentication and has been studied by scholars and students of knowledge for over a millennium.

Beyond his famous Sahih, Imam al-Bukhari authored numerous other works on Hadith sciences and Islamic topics. He was known for his piety, generosity, and devotion to worship, praying 300 rak'ahs nightly during Ramadan. He passed away in 870 CE in Khartank, near Samarkand, leaving behind a legacy of preserving the Prophet's teachings for future generations.
