## Foundations of hadith criticism

The science of hadith developed to protect the Sunnah from fabrication. Scholars scrutinised the chains of narration,
examined the biographies of narrators, and compared texts for consistency. Understanding these principles empowers students
to appreciate the meticulous efforts taken to preserve authentic knowledge.

## Major classifications

Hadith are graded based on narrational strength, continuity, and integrity of transmitters. This guide breaks down the
criteria for *sahih*, *hasan*, and *da'if* narrations, including examples from canonical collections. It also explains key
terms such as *mutawatir* and *ahad* in accessible language.

## Applying the principles today

Modern students encounter translations, summaries, and digital content that claim authenticity. By internalising the
methodology of the muhaddithin, one can distinguish between reliable narrations and doubtful reports, preserving the
religion from misrepresentation.
