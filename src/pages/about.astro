  <p>
    The Salafi Science Network is a collaborative effort to curate lessons, translations, and primary source material
    that reflect the understanding of the righteous predecessors. With contributions from students of knowledge and
    translators, our goal is to facilitate structured learning for families, institutes, and individual seekers.
  </p>
  <p>
    Every resource is reviewed against the Quran and Sunnah upon the understanding of the companions and the scholars
    who traversed their path. Our platform connects learners to books, audio series, and scholarly guidance that
    illuminates the straight path with clarity and certainty.
  </p>
  <h2>What we provide</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Structured lesson pathways tailored for different levels of study.</li>
    <li>Audio reminders and lecture series with reliable translations.</li>
    <li>Curated articles and fatwas addressing contemporary questions.</li>
    <li>Biographies of recognised scholars and a roadmap for consistent growth.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    We invite students, translators, and communities to partner with this project so that beneficial knowledge reaches
    every home. May Allah place sincerity and barakah in this endeavour.
