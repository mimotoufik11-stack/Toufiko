## Introduction

The Islamic framework of halal (permissible) and haram (prohibited) provides comprehensive guidance for all aspects of human life. This divine classification is not arbitrary but based on Allah's perfect wisdom and knowledge of what benefits or harms His creation.

## The Foundation of Islamic Ethics

The principle in Islamic law is that all things are fundamentally halal unless there is clear evidence prohibiting them. This principle, established in the Qur'an and explained by the Prophet (ﷺ), reflects the mercy and ease inherent in Islam. The five major categories of Islamic rulings are: obligatory (wajib), recommended (mustahabb), permissible (mubah), disliked (makruh), and prohibited (haram).

## Criteria for Prohibition

Islamic scholars have established clear criteria for determining what is haram. Anything that causes definitive harm to individuals or society, leads to corruption, or violates divine commands falls under prohibition. This includes intoxicants, pork, blood, improperly slaughtered animals, interest, and illicit relationships.

## Contemporary Applications

In modern times, scholars apply these timeless principles to new phenomena such as financial instruments, food additives, medical procedures, and digital technologies. The methodology involves examining the substance, effect, and context of each matter to reach an Islamic ruling based on authentic evidences.

Understanding this framework enables Muslims to navigate contemporary challenges while maintaining their religious commitment and ethical integrity.
