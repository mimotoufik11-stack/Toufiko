Shaykh Muhammad bin Abdul Wahhab (رحمه الله) was a prominent scholar and reformer from Najd, Arabia, known for his revival of pure Tawheed and his efforts to eliminate innovations and polytheistic practices that had crept into Muslim societies. Born in 1703 CE in the city of Uyaynah, he belonged to a family of scholars and received his early education from his father, Shaykh Abdul Wahhab.

The Shaykh traveled extensively in search of knowledge, studying under numerous scholars in Mecca, Medina, Basra, and other centers of Islamic learning. His most influential teacher was Shaykh Abdullah bin Ibrahim bin Saif, under whom he studied the science of Hadith and the methodology of the Salaf.

His major contribution was his emphasis on returning to the pure understanding of Tawheed as practiced by the Prophet (ﷺ) and his companions. He authored several important works, most notably "Kitab at-Tawheed" (The Book of Monotheism), which remains one of the most widely studied books on Islamic creed worldwide.

Shaykh Muhammad bin Abdul Wahhab established a scholarly alliance with the Al Saud family, which led to the establishment of the first Saudi state and the implementation of Shariah based on the understanding of the Salaf. His teachings continue to influence millions of Muslims through his writings and the institutions he helped establish.
