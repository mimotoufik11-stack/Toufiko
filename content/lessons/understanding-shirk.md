This lesson provides a detailed examination of shirk (polytheism) and its various forms as understood by Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa'ah. Students will learn the three categories of shirk: major shirk which expels from Islam, minor shirk which does not expel but is a major sin, and hidden shirk that occurs in the heart.

The lesson covers contemporary manifestations of shirk, including seeking intercession through the dead, wearing amulets, and relying on other than Allah. Each concept is supported with evidences from the Qur'an and authentic Sunnah, along with explanations from classical scholars such as Ibn Taymiyyah and Ibn al-Qayyim.

Practical guidance is provided for recognizing and avoiding shirk in daily life, making this essential knowledge for every Muslim seeking to purify their worship and ensure their faith remains upon the correct foundation.
