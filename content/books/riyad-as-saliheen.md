Riyad as-Saliheen (The Gardens of the Righteous) by Imam Yahya ibn Sharaf an-Nawawi (631-676 AH) is one of the most beloved and widely studied collections of Hadith in the Muslim world. This comprehensive compilation contains approximately 1,900 authentic Hadith that cover virtually every aspect of a Muslim's life, from beliefs and worship to character and social relations.

The book is uniquely organized into 372 chapters, each focusing on a specific topic such as sincerity, patience, gratitude, prayer, fasting, family relations, and business dealings. This systematic arrangement makes it an ideal reference for both personal study and teaching others. Imam an-Nawawi selected only authentic Hadith from the six major collections and other reliable sources, ensuring the reliability of each narration.

What distinguishes Riyad as-Saliheen is its practical orientation - the Hadith are chosen for their direct relevance to daily life and spiritual development. The compilation serves as both a source of knowledge and a guide for implementation, making it accessible to students at all levels of learning.

The book has been translated into numerous languages and includes valuable explanations by contemporary scholars. It remains one of the most recommended books for new Muslims and those seeking to improve their understanding and practice of Islam based on authentic Prophetic guidance.
