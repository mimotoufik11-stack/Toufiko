## The obligation of following revelation

The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) emphasised that salvation lies in holding fast to the Qur'an and Sunnah upon the understanding of
the Companions. Innovations threaten this salvation by introducing acts of worship that Allah never legislated. The Salaf
warned sternly against treating personal preferences or cultural practices as religion.

## Recognising harmful patterns

The scholars categorised innovation into additions, deletions, and distortions of established worship. Each type undermines
the prophetic method. By identifying the principles of *bid'ah* as outlined by the Salaf, the student can avoid falling into
subtle traps masked as spirituality.

## Returning to the scholars

Our era is filled with doubts and newly introduced practices. The solution remains the same: turn back to qualified scholars
who root their verdicts in authentic evidences. This article provides an actionable framework for evaluating claims and
staying anchored to revelation.
