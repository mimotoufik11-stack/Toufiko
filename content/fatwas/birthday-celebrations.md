## Question

Is it permissible for Muslims to celebrate birthdays with parties, cakes, and gifts? Is this considered an imitation of non-Muslims?

## Answer

The scholars of the Permanent Committee have ruled that celebrating birthdays is not permissible in Islam for several reasons:

First, it is an innovation in religion as neither the Prophet (ﷺ), his companions, nor the righteous predecessors celebrated birthdays. The Prophet (ﷺ) said: "Whoever innovates something in this matter of ours that is not part of it, will have it rejected."

Second, it involves imitation of non-Muslims, which is prohibited. The Prophet (ﷺ) stated: "Whoever imitates a people is one of them."

Third, such celebrations often involve prohibited elements such as music, mixing of unrelated men and women, extravagance, and other violations of Islamic principles.

## Alternative Approaches

Instead of birthday celebrations, Muslims should express gratitude to Allah for the blessing of another year of life through increased worship, charity, and good deeds. One may also thank parents for their care and make dua for continued guidance and blessings.

The scholars emphasize that Islam provides complete guidance for all occasions, and there is no need to adopt practices from other cultures or religions.
