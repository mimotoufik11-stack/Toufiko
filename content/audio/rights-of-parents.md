In this heart-touching audio lecture, Shaykh Abdullah al-Bukhari elaborates on the rights of parents in Islam and the immense status Allah has granted them. The scholar begins by establishing the foundation from the Qur'an and Sunnah, highlighting the repeated command to obey parents that comes immediately after the command to worship Allah.

The lecture covers various aspects of parental rights, including obedience, respect, financial support, making dua for them, and maintaining family ties. Shaykh al-Bukhari provides practical examples of how to fulfill these rights in contemporary contexts while balancing other obligations.

Special attention is given to the rights of non-Muslim parents, the limits of obedience to parents, and how to handle situations where parents ask for something that contradicts Islamic teachings. The lecture concludes with encouragement to honor parents while they are alive and to continue making dua for them after their passing.
