## Early Life and Background

Muhammad ibn Abdullah was born in Mecca around 570 CE to a noble family of the Quraish. His father Abdullah died before his birth, and his mother Aminah died when he was six years old. He was subsequently raised by his grandfather Abdul Muttalib and then his uncle Abu Talib. According to Islamic tradition, even before prophethood, Muhammad was known for his integrity and trustworthiness.

## The Call to Prophethood

At age forty, while meditating in the cave of Hira near Mecca, Muhammad received the first revelation from Angel Gabriel. The experience was profound and transformative. After initial doubt, his wife Khadijah and close companions convinced him of the authenticity of his mission. These early years saw slow, often isolated adherents embracing Islam.

## The Meccan Period

For thirteen years in Mecca, Muhammad preached monotheism against significant opposition. The Meccan elite, economically dependent on polytheism and pagan pilgrimage, opposed him fiercely. Believers faced harassment and torture. Yet the Prophet's patience and steadfastness inspired them. By the end of the Meccan period, several hundred believed in him despite persecution.

## The Migration (Hijra)

In 622 CE, facing intensified persecution, Muhammad and believers migrated to Medina at the city's invitation. This migration marked the beginning of the Islamic calendar and transformed Islam from a persecuted faith to an organized community with political and military dimensions.

## The Medinan Years

In Medina, Muhammad established the first Islamic state, governed by Islamic principles. He negotiated treaties with neighboring tribes, developed jurisprudential systems, and led military expeditions to defend Islam. His leadership was characterized by justice, consultation, and adherence to ethical principles even in conflict.

## Theological and Social Teachings

Muhammad's message addressed all aspects of life: spiritual guidance, legal principles, ethical standards, and social organization. He prohibited slavery's abuse, elevated women's status significantly above pre-Islamic Arabia, and established principles of justice and mutual responsibility.

## The Conquest and Final Years

By the time of his death in 632 CE, the Prophet had unified the Arabian Peninsula under Islam. The faith that began with one man preaching in Mecca had become a dynamic civilization spanning vast territories. His final pilgrimage established practices followed by believers ever since.
