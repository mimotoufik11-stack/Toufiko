Shaykh al-Islam Taqi ad-Din Ahmad ibn Abdul Halim ibn Abdus-Salam ibn Taymiyyah al-Harrani (رحمه الله), commonly known as Ibn Taymiyyah, was one of the most influential scholars in Islamic history. Born in 1263 CE in Harran, he later moved to Damascus with his family, which included several generations of renowned scholars.

From an early age, Ibn Taymiyyah displayed extraordinary intellectual abilities, memorizing the Qur'an by age seven and beginning his study of Islamic sciences shortly thereafter. He mastered various disciplines including Tafsir, Hadith, Fiqh, Usul al-Fiqh, Arabic language, and comparative religion. His teachers included some of the most eminent scholars of his time.

Ibn Taymiyyah was known for his courage in speaking truth to power and his unwavering commitment to following the Qur'an and Sunnah as understood by the Salaf. He faced significant opposition and imprisonment due to his refutations of philosophical deviations and his defense of pure Islamic creed.

His scholarly contributions are immense, with hundreds of works covering virtually every Islamic science. His most famous books include "Al-Jawab as-Sahih li-man Baddala Din al-Masih" (The Correct Response to those who altered the Religion of the Messiah), "Minhaj as-Sunnah an-Nabawiyyah," and numerous fatawa that continue to guide Muslims to this day.

Despite facing persecution throughout his life, Ibn Taymiyyah remained steadfast in calling to Tawheed and defending the Sunnah until his death in 1328 CE. His legacy continues through his students, most notably Imam Ibn al-Qayyim, and his enduring influence on Islamic scholarship.
