## Question

How can Muslims use social media platforms for dawah while avoiding the many prohibitions and trials present online?

## Answer

The scholars acknowledge that social media can be a beneficial tool for dawah when used correctly, but it requires adherence to Islamic guidelines to avoid falling into prohibited matters.

## Permissible Uses

Allowed uses of social media include:
- Sharing authentic Islamic knowledge and reminders
- Correcting misconceptions about Islam
- Connecting with scholars and students of knowledge
- Organizing beneficial activities and lectures
- Muslim matrimonial purposes with proper supervision

## Prohibited Matters to Avoid

Users must strictly avoid:
- Free mixing with unrelated members of the opposite gender

The scholars recommend:
- Setting specific time limits for social media use
- Following only beneficial accounts and scholars
- Using privacy settings appropriately
- Avoiding private conversations with unrelated non-mahrams
- Prioritizing offline worship and family responsibilities
- Regularly auditing one's feed and following list

The primary goal should be using these platforms primarily for benefit while minimizing harm, always remembering that online activities are subject to Allah's surveillance and will be questioned on the Day of Judgment.
