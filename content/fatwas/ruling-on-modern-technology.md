## The Question

Many Muslims inquire whether using modern technology—smartphones, computers, the internet, and other innovations—is permissible in Islam or whether it contradicts Islamic values. This is particularly relevant as technology becomes increasingly integrated into daily life and represents challenges parents, educators, and religious scholars must address.

## The Islamic Principle

The fundamental Islamic principle is that all things are permissible (halal) unless explicitly prohibited by the Qur'an, authentic Sunnah, or scholarly consensus. Technology itself is morally neutral; its permissibility depends on its use and objectives. The Prophet (ﷺ) adopted technologies available in his time, including warfare strategies and architectural innovations.

## Permissible Uses

Technology is permissible when used for beneficial purposes: acquiring knowledge, facilitating communication between families, conducting lawful business, or assisting individuals with disabilities. The internet enables access to Islamic knowledge, connection with scholars, and coordination of charitable work. These applications reflect technology's positive potential.

## Prohibited Applications

Technology becomes impermissible when used for prohibited purposes: consuming or distributing immoral content, engaging in fraud or deception, or spreading false information. The medium (technology) does not change the ruling; if an action is prohibited, engaging in it through technology remains prohibited.

## Recommendations and Safeguards

While technology is permissible, scholars recommend safeguards: limiting children's screen time, establishing technology-free family periods, filtering inappropriate content, and teaching digital ethics. Parents should model responsible usage. Communities should develop social mechanisms to address technology-related harms while embracing beneficial applications.

## Balancing Tradition and Innovation

Islam historically embraced knowledge and tools serving legitimate purposes. Muslim scholars developed mathematics, astronomy, medicine, and engineering. Similarly, contemporary Muslims should evaluate modern technology pragmatically—accepting genuinely beneficial innovations while rejecting those causing harm or violating Islamic principles.

## Conclusion

Modern technology is permissible in Islam with the understanding that its use should serve legitimate purposes and avoid harm. The responsibility lies with individuals to use technology wisely, parents to guide family members appropriately, and communities to establish ethical frameworks supporting beneficial technology use while preventing abuse.
