Kitab at-Tawheed (The Book of Monotheism) by Shaykh Muhammad bin Abdul Wahhab is arguably the most influential book written on the subject of Islamic monotheism in recent centuries. This masterpiece systematically explains the concept of Tawheed, its categories, and what nullifies it, making complex theological concepts accessible to the average Muslim while maintaining scholarly precision.

The book is structured around verses from the Qur'an and authentic Hadith, with each chapter focusing on a specific aspect of Tawheed. The author begins by establishing the foundation of La ilaha illa Allah and then progressively builds understanding through evidences and explanations. Topics covered include the three categories of Tawheed (Rububiyyah, Uluhiyyah, and Asma wa Sifat), the conditions of the Shahada, things that nullify Islam, and common forms of polytheism.

What makes this book particularly valuable is its practical approach - it doesn't merely present theoretical concepts but addresses real-world practices and beliefs that contradict pure Tawheed. The author draws from the statements of the Salaf to explain each point, ensuring authenticity and scholarly credibility.

This book has been translated into dozens of languages and studied worldwide in mosques, Islamic schools, and universities. It serves as essential reading for every Muslim seeking to understand the foundation of their faith and protect themselves from practices that compromise their monotheism.
