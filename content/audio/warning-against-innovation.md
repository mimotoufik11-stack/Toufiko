This powerful audio lecture by Shaykh Rabee' al-Madkhali delivers a stern warning against religious innovations (bid'ah) and their destructive effects on the Muslim ummah. The scholar begins by defining bid'ah and explaining the famous statement of the Prophet (ﷺ): "Every innovation is misguidance."

Shaykh Rabee' meticulously categorizes various forms of innovations that have crept into Muslim communities, from invented worship practices to distorted beliefs. He provides historical context for how these innovations entered the religion and demonstrates how they deviate from the pure path of the Salaf.

The lecture includes detailed explanations of the evidences against innovation, stories of how the companions and early scholars opposed innovations, and practical guidance for protecting oneself and one's community from newly invented matters. This lecture is particularly relevant in modern times where numerous practices foreign to Islam have become widespread among Muslims.
